<h4>Standard Template Library</h4>
<p>
    The Stadard Template Libary is an extensive collection of templates for useful data 
    structures and algorithms.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Most of the templates in the STL can be grouped inot the following categories:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Containers: </b>Class templates for objects that store and organize data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Iterators: </b>Class templates for objects that behave like pointers and are used to access the
            individual data elements in a container.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Algorithms: </b>Function teplates that perfomr various operations on elements of containers.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Containers and Iterators</h4>
<p>
    A container is an object that holds a collection of values or other objects. An iterator is an object that is 
    used to iterate over the items ina a collection.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are 2 types of containers: <i>sequence</i> and <i>associative</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Array Classes</i> are classes that work similar to an regular array but can return the size() of it.
        </br>
        <b>Example: </b> array<int, 5> number = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    </li>
</ul>
