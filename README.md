# Complete-Data-Structures
All data structures known by Edwin Campuzano.

The following contains all of the data structures components
with comments for anyone needing help and need further explanation.

All of the code is written in C++ 11 and can be compiled using the 
"g++ -std=c++11 file_name.cpp -o your_executable". Some may not require 
the specification of "-std=c++11", but its good practice to add it anyway.

Data Structures added to "Complete-Data-Structures":
    List
        Single Linked List
        Circular Linked List
        Doubly Linked Lits
    Stacks
        Stack with Arrays
        Stacks with linked list
    Trees
        Binary Trees
        Binary Search Trees
        AVL Trees


UPDATE: May 1, 2020
    Currently not all classes are completed, still needs to check wich ones.
    Will need to delete all namespace std evetually. Must replace std:: for all classes.
    Currently working on StackWithLinkedList(Template).
    Will work my way up the line.

UPDATE: May 5, 2020
    I have been working on the Binary Tree folder where the binary search tree and 
    AVL tree will be implemented. I deleted the Binary search tree folder becasuse it 
    is not complete and its not required to be here.
    Updated the files to include std::.

NEEDs FIX:
    StackWithLinkedList(Template) -> Stack.H -> inst_mult();
