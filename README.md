# Complete-Data-Structures
All data structures known by Edwin Campuzano.

The following contains all of the data structures components
with comments for anyone needing help and need further explanation.

All of the code is written in C++ 11 and can be compiled using the 
"g++ -std=c++11 file_name.cpp -o your_executable". Some may not require 
the specification of "-std=c++11", but its good practice to add it anyway.

UPDATE: May 1, 2020
    Currently not all classes are completed, still needs to check wich ones.
    Will need to delete all namespace std evetually. Must replace std:: for all classes.
    Currently working on StackWithLinkedList(Template).
    Will work my way up the line.

UPDATE: May 5, 2020
    I have been working on the Binary Tree folder where the binary search tree and 
    AVL tree will be implemented. I deleted the Binary search tree folder becasuse it 
    is not complete and its not required to be here.
    Updated the files to include std::.

UPDATE: May 6, 2020
    Working on the BinarySearchTree fodlder to practice deletion. 
    

NEEDs FIX:
    StackWithLinkedList(Template) -> Stack.H -> inst_mult(); COMPLETED
    BinarySearchTree(Template) -> BinarySearchTree.h -> makeDeletion();  FINISHED


To-Do:
    Add AVL tree to the binary tree template class. 
    Create a B-Tree from scratch for practice. 
    Fix AVL tree code.
    Check all of the code to see if it works.
